# Source of data : 
healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv

2) gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"
3) age: age of the patient
4) hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension

# Data Description : 
This is a healthcare dataset used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient. This is a binary classification problem.
There are 2 possible classes : predict stroke (target): 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not. These classes are highly unbalanced.
The data contains 12 attributes (columns or features) and 5110 observations (rows), each row represents a specific patient.
